## Compiling and testing
Workbook / `workbench.library` is in ROM.

- With the [`master`](https://github.com/ApolloTeam-dev/AROS) branch, which is the default, use `build_all.sh`.
- If you are using the [`mkapollo.sh`](https://github.com/ApolloTeam-dev/AROS/blob/v4-alynna/mkapollo.sh) script, `./mkapollo.sh kernel` suffices to build it. There are some improvements pending merge at: [Some mkapollo.sh enhancements #27](https://github.com/ApolloTeam-dev/AROS/pull/27)
- The ROM is written to `./aros.rom`, and it must be under 1MB total or 512KB for each of `rom` and `ext`. `mkapollo.sh` will tell you after compilation whether it fits or is too big.
- Copy `./aros.rom` to the V4SA, and load it with `C:VControl MAPROM=aros.rom`: the V4SA will reboot with that ROM. To go back to the previous ROM, just power off the machine. More details at: https://github.com/flype44/VControl/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#vcontrol-maprom
