Here's the source code for the utilities from the "bin" directory,
plus some sample code for accessing special I²C chips (VPS decoder,
melody chip and a 4×7 LED display).

These programs were written for the GNU C compiler. They should work
with others as well, however GNU C is the one with smoothest support
for installing the i2clib include files (see "Developers" directory).

Regarding the special chips: If you already own such hardware, good
for you, but there is no documentation on building the hardware, and
I'm not going to supply any (with one exception, see below).

You can retrieve data sheets for many I2C chips in PDF format from the
Philips homepage. Try

In particular, these are the URLs for the chips mentioned above:

the above links should fail, try and start at www.philips.com.



The PCD3312 DTMF/modem/musical-tone generator

           __  __
   GND 1 -|  \/  |- 8 SDA
   +5V 2 -|      |- 7 SCL
  OSCI 3 -|      |- 6 A0
  OSCO 4 -|______|- 5 TONE

OSCI/OSCO: connect a 3.58 MHz quartz here
A0: connect to GND for slave address 0x48
     "       " +5V  "   "     "      0x4a
TONE: DON'T connect a loudspeaker directly, that wouldn't work anyway,
    rather do something like this:

        100nF
TONE ----||-----+      Ampl.
